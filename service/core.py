#      (attach the calling thread to the current foreground window's thread across
#      the SetForegroundWindow call) lets a background process legitimately take
#      the foreground. We deliberately do NOT tap ALT to lift the lock — ALT
#      activates Studio's menu bar and the subsequent Ctrl+S then targets the menu
#      and no-ops. AppActivate stays as a last-ditch fallback.
#
#   2. **Integrity level (the load-bearing requirement):** SendKeys is a UIPI
#      operation — a MEDIUM-integrity process cannot inject input into a HIGHER-
#      integrity (elevated) window. So the service and Studio must run at the SAME
#      integrity. The normal case is both non-elevated: a layman double-clicks
#      Studio (medium) and the service task is RunLevel=Limited (medium) — save
#      works. If Studio is launched ELEVATED (e.g. from an admin/RunLevel=Highest
#      context) while the service is Limited, SetForegroundWindow can still read
#      True but the Ctrl+S is silently dropped by UIPI and the save no-ops to
#      saved=False. Diagnosed live (an elevated-launch test
#      artifact): a medium service could not save an elevated Studio; relaunching
#      Studio non-elevated made every service /save succeed (~1.5-2.7s). Fix if you
#      hit this: run Studio non-elevated, or run the service RunLevel=Highest.
#      saved=False with focused=True across repeated calls is the integrity-
#      mismatch tell (surfaced as a hint on the save result).

    """Capture the runtime canvas via CDP Page.captureScreenshot (JPEG).

    Saves server-side when save_path is given (else returns base64).

    Navigation, so the caller never needs to know the runtime URL:
      - navigate_url omitted (None): auto-target the local Optix runtime,
        skipping the reload if the tab is already there (preserving prior
        click/nav state). This is the common "show me the runtime" case.
      - navigate_url given: point the page there first.
      - navigate_url == "": screenshot whatever the tab currently shows.
    After a navigation it waits settle_seconds for the Optix canvas to render
    (capturing mid-navigation fails).

    fresh=True additionally guards against the "stale tab after
    optix_emulator(action='restart')" trap: the runtime process gets a new PID but
    keeps the SAME URL, so the auto-target check above sees the tab is
    "already there" and would otherwise skip navigating entirely, and even
    a forced reload can still be served from Chrome's cache instead of
    actually re-fetching from (and reconnecting to) the restarted runtime.
    So when fresh=True:
      1. if the auto-target above didn't navigate, force one with
         ignore_cache=True (bypasses cache — a plain reload can't).
      2. after capturing, compare this capture's bytes to the last fresh
         capture taken from this cfg.cdp_url. Byte-IDENTICAL is the
         observed signature of a screenshot that's still looking at a
         pre-restart frame (three restarts, three identical screenshots
         was the reported failure). On a match: close this CDP session,
         open a new one (drops any wedged debugger/session state), hard
         reload the runtime URL bypassing cache, wait settle again, and
         recapture ONCE — never loops, so a capture that's genuinely
         unchanged (nothing to see) isn't retried forever. The result
         carries `stale_recovery: {attempted, resolved}` so this is never
         silent — the caller (and the agent reading the JSON) can see a
         recovery fired instead of quietly re-serving a stale frame.
    fresh=False never touches this cache — repeated identical screenshots
    are an expected, legitimate outcome of "confirm nothing changed".

    Before capture, the emulated device viewport is (re)set to
    cfg.cdp_viewport_width x cfg.cdp_viewport_height @ cfg.cdp_viewport_scale
    (default 1280x720 @ 1, tune via OPTIX_CDP_VIEWPORT / OPTIX_CDP_SCALE) so
    the capture isn't clipped to chrome-cdp's launch window size. A rejected
    override (older Chrome/CDP) is a safe no-op — the capture still proceeds
    at whatever size is in effect. This is the SAME override every other CDP
    tool applies at session-open (see _cdp_session), so click/route-replay
    coordinates computed from this screenshot stay valid in a later call.

    region: optional [x, y, w, h] clip, resolved via CDP
    Page.captureScreenshot's native `clip`. Coordinate convention: if ALL
    four values are <= 1.0 they are normalized fractions of the viewport
    (resolved against Page.getLayoutMetrics); if any value is > 1 the whole
    list is absolute pixels. A malformed region (wrong length, negative,
    zero w/h, x/y outside the frame) returns state='failed',
    error='bad_region' — never raises.

    Returns {state, path|b64, size_bytes, navigated, captured_at, region}
    (+ `stale_recovery` when fresh=True triggered the recovery path above).
    `region` in the result is the resolved absolute-pixel [x, y, w, h] (or
    None when no region was requested).

    Loads routes_path exactly like cdp_navigate_runtime (same routes file
    format and error contract: missing file -> 'routes_file_not_found',
    bad JSON -> 'routes_file_invalid'). Sweeps every route in the file, in
    file order, unless `routes` names a subset — then that subset, in the
    given order; a name in `routes` not present in the file fails the whole
    call with error='route_not_found' (with `available` listing known
    routes), same contract as cdp_navigate_runtime.

    Each route's steps replay through the SAME step-execution as
    cdp_navigate_runtime (_run_route_steps: click -> settle_seconds), but
    expect_text checks are ALWAYS disabled here (expect=False) — sweep is a
    capture pass, not a verification pass. ASSUMPTION: routes start from
    the runtime's initial/home screen (the same assumption banking them for
    cdp_navigate_runtime makes). Between routes the tab is re-navigated
    back to the runtime URL (the same auto-target navigate/screenshot use)
    so each route starts clean; the first route relies on the same
    auto-target the other CDP tools use (skips the navigate if already
    there).

    warmup=True (default): before the real capture, takes and discards one
    full-frame screenshot and waits one settle period — lets
    animations/renders finish so the saved frame isn't a mid-transition
    capture. Saves the full-frame JPEG to <out_dir>/<route>.jpg (route
    names sanitized via _sanitize_route_filename). If tesseract is
    available, OCRs the saved JPEG (stdout, psm 6) and stores its non-empty
    stripped lines as `text`.

    A capture failure on one route — a malformed banked step (an
    out-of-viewport coordinate), or a genuine CDP transport error mid-route
    — does NOT abort the sweep: that route is recorded as {"error": ...} in
    `screens` and the sweep continues (a partial sweep beats none). The
    response then carries "errors": N.

    screens by route key. A missing manifest in either dir fails outright:
    state='failed', error='manifest_not_found', naming the offending `dir`.
    Screens present in only one manifest are reported under `added`
    (only in B) / `removed` (only in A) — not treated as errors. A screen
    whose sweep entry in either manifest carries its own {"error": ...}
    (a route that failed to capture) degrades to {"status": "error",
    "detail": ...} and counts toward summary.errors, rather than crashing
    the whole diff.

    Pixel gate (Pillow present — the `visual` optional dependency group,
    lazy-imported via _load_pil so it stays fully optional): opens both
    JPEGs; a size mismatch short-circuits to {"status": "size_mismatch"}
    (no pixel compare, no text explainer); otherwise both are converted to
    grayscale and compared via mean absolute pixel difference scaled to a
    0-100 percentage (`pixel_pct` = mean_abs_diff * 100 / 255); `changed`
    when pixel_pct > threshold (default 2.0), else `same`. An unreadable/
    missing JPEG for a common screen degrades that ONE screen to
    {"status": "error", ...} rather than failing the whole diff.

    Pillow ABSENT: DEGRADED text-only mode. Requires BOTH manifests to
    carry OCR text (their top-level `ocr` flag true, written by
    cdp_sweep_runtime when tesseract ran) — if neither/either does, this
    fails outright: error='no_pillow_no_ocr', with an install hint (Pillow
    for pixels, tesseract for text). Otherwise each common screen's status
    comes from exact equality of the two manifests' OCR `text` lists,
    `pixel_pct` is null, and the top-level response carries
    degraded='no_pillow'.

    Every 'changed' screen additionally gets a text explainer —
    `text_added` / `text_removed` — diffing the two manifests' `text`
    lists (empty list if a manifest wasn't OCR'd), via _text_line_diff
    (order-preserving, capped at 40 lines each with a '+N more' sentinel).

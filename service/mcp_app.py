        optix_health / optix_doctor / optix_services_status / optix_studio_version
        (each formerly its own tool); replaced cleanly, no deprecated aliases.

        These four are HETEROGENEOUS — pick the one that matches what you
        actually need, they are not interchangeable:

        action:
          - "health" — FAST preflight config snapshot (export-based, v0.2.x):
            projects_root, studio_exe, runtime_dir, interactive_session, bind
            config. Use this when the user asks "is everything wired up?",
            "is studio installed?", or before a deploy attempt to fail fast on
            missing config.
          - "doctor" — setup-FIX checklist: every prerequisite plus a plain-
            English fix for each. `ready` is True when the REQUIRED deps
            (Studio, projects folder) are present; feature checks (bridge, cdp,
            deploy creds, interactive session) report their own fix and gate
            only their own feature. Use this for first-time setup, after a
            reboot/config change, or when a tool failed and you want to know
            which dependency is missing.
          - "services" — LIVE dashboard aggregate: health + studio version +
            runtime/cdp probes in one call — the HMI status-tile payload. Use
            this for rendering an operator dashboard's services panel, or when
            the user asks "what's the state of the deploy stack right now?"
          - "version" — raw `FTOptixStudio.exe --version` output. Use this when
            debugging a deploy failure and you want to confirm the binary
            works, or the user asks which Studio version is installed.

        An unknown `action` returns a structured error rather than raising.

        Use this when:
          - you need ANY status/health/version read on the deploy stack — pick
            the action matching the question (see above); action="doctor" is
            the right default when you're not sure which one you need

        Do NOT use this when:

            runtime stack, not the authored HMI model

        open with the bridge armed. `editor_project_open` (409) means
        VS/VS Code has THIS project open.

        Mechanism: applies `edits` to the project tree, git-commits with
        `commit_message`, runs `FTOptixStudio.exe export`, atomically swaps
        the bundle into OPTIX_RUNTIME_DIR/<project>/, bounces the runtime,
        and probes the runtime port until it answers. UpdateSvc / OPC UA is
        NOT in this path.

        `project`: omit — defaults to the bridge's served project.

        `edits`: list of edit dicts, UTF-8 plaintext only. THREE MODES —
        prefer the anchored modes, fall back to full-content only for new
        files: (1) {"path", "find", "replace", "expect_count"?} — ANCHORED
        REPLACE, preferred for changing existing lines/values; `find` must
        occur exactly expect_count times (default 1) or the whole batch
        refuses (422 edit_anchor_mismatch) with nothing written. (2) {"path",
        "insert_after_anchor", "block"} — ANCHORED INSERT, preferred for
        adding nodes/widgets; `block` is inserted after the line containing
        the unique anchor, indent it yourself. (3) {"path", "content"} — FULL
        REPLACE, the only mode that can create a new file; for existing
        files prefer modes 1-2 to avoid drifting unrelated lines. The batch
        is atomic: ALL edits resolve against current disk state before ANY
        file is written; one mismatch refuses all. One edit per path per batch.

        `run_after_deploy`: True bounces + verifies the runtime (runtime_probe).
        False leaves it un-bounced (verification falls back to export_mtime)
        — for staged deploys where another agent flips the runtime separately.

        Use this when:
          - the user wants to apply specific edits and push to the local runtime
          - you've located the target via optix_find / optix_read_file and can

        Do NOT use this when:
          - you have not read the target region first (blind full-content
            writes risk clobbering unrelated changes)

        Verify-half tip: the returned verification.method (runtime_probe)
        proves the runtime is up, NOT that your edit is visible — pair with

        as a wiring audit.

        match="Pump*" turns the call into a LIVE-MODEL SEARCH (name or type).
        MATCHING IS EXACT unless you use * wildcards: match="Grid" only finds
        nodes named/typed exactly "Grid" — GridLayout1 needs "Grid*"/"*Grid*".
        Default to "*substring*" when hunting; a bare word silently returns 0
        hits for partial names. Use this instead of optix_find for live-model
        lookups (optix_find greps FILES, refused while Studio is open).

        IMPORTANT: shows MATERIALIZED nodes only — a property never set does
        NOT appear, and its absence never means you can't set it
        (optix_bridge_set_property materializes on write).

        format="outline" (default, human-readable) or format="json"

            returns `bridge_unavailable`. Uses `project` (omit for the
            bridge's served project).

            `version_b` (the newer/to version); `changed_types` maps a type

        optix_run_emulator / optix_restart_emulator / optix_stop_emulator /
        optix_emulator_status / optix_runtime_log_tail (each formerly its own
        tool); replaced cleanly, no deprecated aliases.

        action:
          - "run" — F5: launch the project in Studio's built-in emulator. THE
            default verify step — much cheaper and faster than a deploy. F5
            stages the in-Studio model (saves as part of staging) and spins up
            a LOCAL FTOptixRuntime. F5 TOGGLES: check action="status" first so
            a blind "run" doesn't stop a running emulator. A RUNNING emulator
            does not pick up Studio edits (separate process, its own loaded
            snapshot) — structural changes (new widgets, bindings, layout)
            need action="restart". TARGET GUARD: F5 runs Studio's SELECTED
            deployment target; a non-emulator target refuses
            (active_target_not_emulator) — the service never changes the
            dropdown. `save_first` stages+saves before launching.
          - "restart" — stop-if-running -> start -> wait until serving, in ONE
            call. THE way to make a STRUCTURAL edit visible (new widget,
            binding, layout) — removes the F5-toggle footgun. No save needed
            (starting stages and saves the current Studio model).
          - "stop" — explicit, unambiguous stop (vs "run", which toggles and
            is easy to double-fire). Terminates ONLY emulator instances
            (--application-name=Emulator); an UpdateSvc-deployed runtime is
            the same exe and is left alone.
          - "status" — not_running / starting / running. Counts ONLY real
            emulator processes. state=starting means the port isn't serving
            yet — wait before screenshotting; running means safe to
            screenshot. Check this before "run" to avoid the F5-toggle trap.
          - "log" — tail the emulator's runtime log (NetLogic output,
            exceptions) — the debug signal when a preview misbehaves.
            Non-blocking: one brief shared read of the newest
            FTOptixRuntime.*.log (never poll this in a tight loop). `lines`
            caps the tail (default 100); `contains` filters case-
            insensitively. NOTE: the log is NOT rotated per restart — a
            `contains="error"` hit may be HOURS old; check timestamps before
            treating a match as current.

        `project`: used by "run"/"restart" (defaults to the bridge's served
        project; a structured no-project error if neither is given) and "log"
        (same resolution, required). Ignored by "stop"/"status" — those are
        process-level, not project-scoped. `save_first` only applies to
        "run". `lines`/`contains` only apply to "log".

        An unknown `action` returns a structured error rather than raising.

        Use this when:
          - previewing/verifying a bridge edit, or debugging why a preview
            looks wrong — pick the action for what you need (see above)

        THE SHIP STEP — deliberate, not the everyday verify. For iteration,
        use optix_emulator(action="run") + optix_cdp_screenshot instead (much
        faster, no transfer); deploy AFTER the emulator preview confirms the
        change.
        WORKS WITH STUDIO OPEN (contrast optix_deploy, which REFUSES while
        Studio is open): the `deploy` verb spawns its OWN short-lived Studio
        to build+transfer, so your interactive Studio + bridge stay up the
        whole time.

        Mechanism: runs the Studio `deploy` verb, which opens the SAVED
        project from disk, builds it, and transfers it to the UpdateSvc at
        the configured deploy IP (OPTIX_DEPLOY_IP / _USERNAME / _THUMBPRINT,
        OPTIX_STUDIO_DEPLOYMENT_PASSWORD). With run_after=True and a
        logged-in deploy user, the verb starts the runtime itself. Saves the
        project first by default (save_first) — the deploy reads disk, so
        unsaved edits would otherwise not ship.

        NOTE: when Studio is open the result carries a `build_race_warning` —
        ADVISORY ONLY (`deployed` is still true, the change is live); it just
        flags that the open Studio's build could race the verb's build (the
        verb retries and wins). Not a reason to close Studio.

        disable_source_transfer: skip sending the source .optix tree to the
        target (built runtime only — faster; the default). Pass False to
        force the source onto the target when you'll open/edit it there.

        Use this when:
          - the emulator preview looks right and you're shipping the change
          - shipping to a real device/UpdateSvc (multi-box, production)

    # optix_routes_save (bank) -> optix_cdp_navigate/optix_cdp_sweep (replay).

    # ---- consolidated routes surface -----------------------------------
    # optix_routes collapses optix_routes_save / _get / _list into one

    # registered tools = fewer ToolSearch deferral round-trips). Low-traffic

    # trade-off optix_bridge_edit makes for its most-privileged dispatched
    # op. Scope note: TOOL_SCOPES["optix_routes"] = "author" (was "read" for
    # get/list, "author" for save) — a deliberate tightening so a bare `read`
    # token can no longer call action="get"/"list"; this family sees no

            routes-banking loop for optix_interact(action="navigate") /
            optix_cdp_sweep. Requires `routes`: either the full versioned
            shape (`{"version": 1, "routes": {"<name>": {"steps": [...]}}}`)
            or a bare `{"<name>": {"steps": [...]}}` mapping — both
            normalize on disk. Each route's `steps` is validated BEFORE
            anything is written: a malformed step anywhere fails
            error='routes_invalid' naming the offending route/step, rather
            than writing a partial file. Saved at `<project>/dev/<name>.json`
            (default "ftx_ui_map"). `name` is sanitized to `[a-zA-Z0-9._-]` —
            anything else fails error='bad_name' before touching disk.
            Saving over an existing `name` REPLACES its content wholesale
            (not a merge). `path` in the result is directly usable as
            `routes_path`.
          - "get" — read back a routes file saved via "save". A bad `name`
            fails error='bad_name' before touching disk (same sanitization
            rule as "save"); a missing file fails 'routes_file_not_found'
            (with `path`); malformed JSON fails 'routes_file_invalid'. Never
            raises for a missing/bad file. Ignores `routes`.
          - "list" — list every routes file saved under the project's
            `dev/` — what's already banked, before you navigate/sweep or
            save more. Only files parsing as a valid routes file (JSON
            object with a dict "routes" key) are listed; anything else under
            dev/*.json is skipped silently and counted in `skipped` — one
            bad file never hides the rest. No dev/ directory yet is not an
            error (files=[], count=0). Ignores `routes`/`name`.

        An unknown `action` returns a structured error rather than raising.

        `region`: all four values <= 1.0 are normalized viewport fractions,

          - "click" — trusted CDP mouse click at (`x`, `y`); the reliable path
            Optix's canvas needs. Requires `x`, `y`.
          - "fill" — ONE call: click (`x`, `y`) -> select-all -> type `text` ->
            commit with `submit` (default Enter; None types without
            committing). THE way to set a TextBox/SpinBox. Requires `x`, `y`,
            `text`.
          - "type" — insert `text` into the already-focused field (no click,
            no commit). Requires `text`.
          - "key" — press one named `key` (Enter/Escape/Tab/Backspace/Delete/
            Arrow*), the commit step for edits. Requires `key`.
          - "navigate" — replay a banked click `route` from `routes_path`
            (zero-screenshot navigation). Requires `route`, `routes_path`.

        Coordinates use the shared convention (<= 1.0 = normalized viewport
        fractions, > 1 = absolute pixels). An unknown `action`, or a missing
        required param, returns a structured error rather than raising.

        VERIFY, don't trust the return: state="succeeded" means the CDP event

        "path": "UI/MainWindow/Gauge1", "name": "Width", "value": "120"}].

        rename, reorder, wire_event, attach_expression, add_translation.

        RENAME: {"op": "rename", "path": "UI/Screens/Foo", "new_name": "Bar"}
        renames a node (the name shown in Studio's tree). Rename re-authors
        the node in place, so it gets a NEW NodeId; inbound references from
        elsewhere are not rewritten. set_property with name=DisplayName sets
        the node's DisplayName ATTRIBUTE (LocalizedText; dedicated safe
        route) — Studio's tree then labels the node "BrowseName (DisplayName)"
        (verified live 2026-08-16); use rename to change the BrowseName part.
        BrowseName itself is never settable directly (it is the node's
        identity) — the attempt is refused.

        WHY BATCH: the bridge validates the ENTIRE list before anything is
        written, against a hypothetical model that accumulates this batch's
        own creates/deletes — so "create a node then set a property on it"
        validates clean, while the reverse order is caught up front with the
        offending `op_index` instead of half-applying. Validation runs FIRST
        and applies nothing on failure (state="validated" with errors), so a
        separate dry_run pass is NOT needed to be safe — reserve
        `dry_run=True` for a genuinely risky batch you want to inspect first.
        `strict=True` promotes lint warnings into errors.

        SIZE: batch ONE component's related ops — a widget plus its
        properties plus its binding — NOT a whole screen; a 100-op
        mega-batch gambles the whole screen on one partial-failure point.

        NOT ATOMIC, and the result says so: if op N fails at apply time, ops
        0..N-1 stay applied (state="partial", `applied` counting what landed).
        Read `applied` — never assume a failure means nothing happened.

        Use this when:
          - you have several related edits for ONE component — batch them so
            they validate and land together

        Do NOT use this when:
